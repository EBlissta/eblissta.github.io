</a></p>

      <p style="font-size: 40px;" >Before Thomas Edison entered the scene, and began commercializing his light bulb, British inventors proved that electric light was possible with the 'arc lamp'. In 1835, the first constant electric light was shown, then, for the next 40 years, scientists around the world worked on the 'incandescent lamp', working with the filament(See How it Works).</p> 
      <p style="font-size: 40px;" >When Edison and his team of researchers started their efforts on lighting, they focused on improving the filament. First, they tested carbon, then platinum, before eventually returning to carbon. By October 1879, Edisonâ€™s team had created a light bulb with a filament of uncoated cotton thread that lasted for 14.5 hours.</p> 
      <p style="font-size: 40px;" >They then experimented with more filaments until desciding to work on one made from bamboo that lasted up to 1,200 hours. That filament became the standard for the 'Edison bulb' for the next 10 years.</p>
