      <h3>A Little History</h3>
      
      <p class="w3-opacity"><a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/history-light-bulb" target="_blank"> History of the Light Bulb 
</a></p>

      <p>Before Thomas Edison entered the scene, and began commercializing his light bulb, British inventors proved that electric light was possible with the 'arc lamp'. In 1835, the first constant electric light was shown, then, for the next 40 years, scientists around the world worked on the 'incandescent lamp', working with the filament(See How it Works).</p> 
      <p>When Edison and his team of researchers started their efforts on lighting, they focused on improving the filament. First, they tested carbon, then platinum, before eventually returning to carbon. By October 1879, Edisonâ€™s team had created a light bulb with a filament of uncoated cotton thread that lasted for 14.5 hours.</p> 
      <p>They then experimented with more filaments until desciding to work on one made from bamboo that lasted up to 1,200 hours. That filament became the standard for the 'Edison bulb' for the next 10 years.</p>

</a></p>

      <p>Light Bulbs convert electricla energy to An electric current is passed through a thin metal filament, heating the filament to a high temperature until it glows and produces light.</p>
      <p>After the electricity has made its way through the tungsten filament, it goes down another wire and out of the bulb via the metal portion at the side of the socket.</p> 
      <p>"When the battery's terminals are connected through the light bulb, a pathway is created for charge to flow. Negatively charged electrons flow from the - terminal to the + terminal through the light bulb. This flow of charge converts chemical potential energy into electrical energy."(https://courses.engr.illinois.edu)</p>

      <h3>Significance Today</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Architect</p>
      <p>The light bulb helped to establish social order after sundown, extended the workday well into the night, and allowed us to navigate and travel safely in the dark. Without the light bulb, there would be no nightlife</p>

      <p>The Light Bulb commenly symbolizs an idea or brilliance, like Benjamin Franklin's brilliant idea of the lightbulb. "The light bulb is the symbol of invention and sometimes of intelligence"(Sybolism.fandom.com).The light bulb is also a symbol of light and connections.The invention of the light bulb changed the world in many ways, including facilitating the creation of large power grids, changing the social and economic structure of society and bringing other appliances into the home.</p>
